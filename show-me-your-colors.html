                What if educational technology protected children's health as a fundamental right instead of prioritizing productivity metrics? Show Me Your Colors is an HRV-based wearable system designed for classroom settings that shifts focus from educational outcomes to physiological well-being. As a researcher-educator, I observed how educational technology often increases monitoring of children's behavior while adding cognitive stress to learning environments. Instead of adding to this complexity, the system uses AI-assisted physiological monitoring to support children's fundamental right to emotional self-regulation and well-being.

            <h2>System Overview</h2>

            <p><strong>AI-assisted HRV monitoring:</strong> The wearable continuously interprets heart rate variability using a lightweight AI model to detect stress or dysregulation.</p>

            <p><strong>Adaptive feedback:</strong> When signs of stress appear, the system prompts the child—through gentle visuals and audio cues—to take a deep breath or refocus on their body, reinforcing early self-awareness habits.</p>

            <p><strong>Parent transparency:</strong> A paired parent remote receives visual updates of the child's physiological state, shifting communication from behavior-based to wellness-based insight.</p>

            <h2>Why AI matters here</h2>
            <p>
                Child development research shows that self-awareness isn't innate—it's learned through repeated practice. Show Me Your Colors integrates AI not as a surveillance mechanism but as a responsive co-regulation tool, encouraging mindful reflection and physiological literacy in children. The system exemplifies how AI can be applied responsibly to nurture emotional intelligence rather than extract data.

            <h3>Visual feedback states</h3>
            <p>
                Early interface explorations used familiar metaphors like ice cream to represent physiological states: full (regulated), melting (transitioning), and melted (dysregulated). The goal was to make health data accessible to both children and parents.
            </p>
            <p>
                Credit to my son, Baby E, for co-creating these playful melting phases and giving the interface its joyful energy.

            <h2>Co-creation with students</h2>
            <p>
                Through participatory design sessions, students explored how to represent physiological states through color and visual metaphors. They created visual vocabularies, tested wearable prototypes, and provided feedback on what made health data feel accessible rather than clinical or stigmatizing.
            </p>

                    <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Arduino HRV wearable with wireless parent remote. Balanced AI-driven insights for caregivers with privacy and agency for students.</p>

                    <p><strong>Key tension:</strong> How do we use AI to support children's well-being while protecting privacy and agency?</p>
