            <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
            <p class="project-summary">
                This case study demonstrates policy design for AI systems interacting with vulnerable users. The project addresses a core tension in AI development: how to provide meaningful support without creating dependency, surveillance, or harm. Through user research with elementary students, I designed a framework that balances child privacy, parental awareness, and AI intervention while accounting for how children actually experience and conceptualize emotions.

            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <p>
                Children experience heightened stress during daily transitions — moving between classes, returning home, processing external events like political elections. While emotional self-awareness is crucial for development, existing approaches either:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ignore children's internal states entirely</li>
                <li>Create surveillance systems that undermine trust and autonomy</li>
                <li>Pathologize normal emotional responses</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Core Policy Question:</strong> How do you give parents visibility into their child's emotional well-being without creating surveillance that undermines trust or autonomy?</p>

            <h2>Design Decisions: Technology Selection</h2>

            <h3>Why AI Over Physiological Markers</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Initial approach:</strong> Chromatic stickers that changed color based on cortisol detection
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Problem:</strong> Physiological detection alone provided data but no intervention framework. Parents would see stress indicators without understanding context or having tools to respond appropriately.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Solution:</strong> Shifted to HRV-based detection paired with AI-guided breathing exercises. This choice was fundamentally about policy control — AI allowed me to design governance rules for: when to intervene, what language to use, how to prevent dependency, and what information parents should access.
            </p>

            <h2>Policy Framework</h2>

            <h3>Privacy Architecture</h3>
            <p>
                The system implements a three-tier information architecture designed to preserve child autonomy while enabling parental support:

                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <p><strong>Key Policy Principle:</strong> Parents receive enough information to offer support ("I saw you had big feelings") without enough information to interrogate, punish, or override the child's choice to share or not share details.</p>

            <h3>Language Framework</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Challenge:</strong> Initial user research revealed children associated emotions with Inside Out color coding (red = anger, blue = sadness). During the 2024 election period, children were mapping these colors onto political narratives: red = Trump = anger = "good," blue = Kamala = sadness = "loser."
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Discovery moment:</strong> At an ice cream parlor with my sons, watching ice cream melt, I realized this metaphor captured what I needed: temporary, normal, manageable, and politically neutral.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Result:</strong> Shifted from color-coded emotions to "melts" — avoiding both political contamination and pathologizing language like "meltdown" or "episode."
            </p>
            <p>
                Credit to my son, Baby E, for co-creating these playful melting phases and giving the interface its joyful energy.

            <h2>Edge Cases & Safeguards</h2>

            <h3>Preventing Misuse</h3>
            <p><strong>Risk:</strong> Parent uses data punitively ("I saw you had a melt today, what did you do wrong?")</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Zero access to triggers, timing, or conversation content</li>
                <li><strong>Language design:</strong> "Big feelings" frames as information, not alarm</li>
                <li><strong>Normalization:</strong> Frequent melts presented as expected, reducing pressure on child</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Dependency Prevention</h3>
            <p><strong>Risk:</strong> Child becomes reliant on AI for emotional regulation</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mitigation:</strong> AI prompts emphasize "you're learning to notice" rather than "let me fix this"</li>
                <li><strong>Scaffolding design:</strong> Prompts gradually reduce frequency as child demonstrates self-regulation</li>
                <li><strong>Human connection:</strong> Parent notification creates opportunity for co-regulation, not AI replacement of human support</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Crisis Escalation</h3>
            <p><strong>Risk:</strong> Child experiencing genuine crisis that exceeds AI capability</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Detection:</strong> Sustained elevated HRV beyond threshold, specific language patterns</li>
                <li><strong>Response:</strong> System immediately notifies parent/teacher with urgency level</li>
                <li><strong>AI behavior:</strong> Shifts to acknowledgment only, stops intervention attempts</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>User Research Insights</h2>
            <p>
                Conducted emotion mapping exercises with elementary students to understand how children conceptualize and express emotional states. Key findings:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Complex emotion vocabulary:</strong> Children used terms like "disgust," "surprised anger," "mad sad," "fear," indicating sophisticated emotional awareness beyond simple happy/sad binary</li>
                <li><strong>Visual representation variation:</strong> Drawings showed diverse ways of expressing same emotion, confirming need for personalized rather than prescriptive emotional frameworks</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural influence:</strong> Strong influence from Inside Out movie created shared emotional vocabulary but also political contamination during election</li>
                <li><strong>Body awareness:</strong> Children could identify physical sensations ("my tummy feels weird") but needed support connecting these to emotional states</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>Design implication:</strong> AI prompts needed to meet children where they are — using their language, validating their experience, and building connection between physical sensation and emotional awareness without imposing adult frameworks.
            </p>

                    <p><strong>Speculative Design Approach:</strong> This project combines policy design with speculative engineering to explore how AI governance frameworks can be embedded into working prototypes. The physical artifacts serve as design probes to test ethical principles in practice.</p>

                    <p><strong>Research:</strong> Observed how edtech increases monitoring and complexity. Explored HRV monitoring with AI-assisted pattern recognition as health-first alternative to behavior tracking.</p>

                    <p><strong>Co-design:</strong> K-5 students created visual metaphors for physiological states through emotion mapping exercises. Ice cream system (full/melting/melted) emerged as culturally neutral and developmentally appropriate.</p>

                    <p><strong>AI Policy Development:</strong> Built lightweight AI model for HRV interpretation paired with governance rules for intervention timing, language design, dependency prevention, and information access controls.</p>

                    <p><strong>Engineering Implementation:</strong> Arduino HRV wearable with wireless parent remote. System architecture designed to enforce privacy boundaries through technical constraints rather than policy alone.</p>

                    <p><strong>Key tension:</strong> How do we use AI to support children's well-being while protecting privacy and agency? The answer required both policy frameworks and technical implementation that makes violating those policies technically difficult.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Privacy architecture successfully balanced parental awareness with child autonomy</li>
                <li>Ice cream metaphor provided culturally neutral, age-appropriate emotional framework</li>

            <h3>Open Questions for Scale</h3>
            <ul>

            <h3>Key Insight</h3>
            <p>
                This project demonstrates that effective AI policy design requires understanding not just technical capability, but human behavior, developmental psychology, cultural context, and the ethics of surveillance vs. support. The hardest work in building AI for vulnerable populations isn't the algorithm — it's the governance framework that determines when and how that algorithm should intervene.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a speculative design engineering project, Show Me Your Colors uses working prototypes to explore how AI governance can be embedded into technical systems. The physical artifacts serve as probes to test whether ethical principles can be enforced through architecture rather than policy alone, demonstrating that the most effective safeguards combine both technical constraints and thoughtful policy design.
