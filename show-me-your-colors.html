                What if classroom technology prioritized student health over productivity? Show Me Your Colors is an HRV-based wearable system designed for classroom settings that shifts focus from educational outcomes to physiological well-being. As a researcher-educator, I observed how edtech creates complexity and surveillance in learning environments. Instead of adding another layer of classroom technology, this system uses heart rate variability monitoring connected to a parent remote, allowing caregivers to understand their child's physiological state throughout the school day.

            <h2>Project overview</h2>
            <p>
                As a researcher-educator working in K-12 classrooms, I witnessed firsthand how educational technology often creates more challenges than solutions by adding cognitive load, surveillance pressure, and fragmentation to already complex learning environments. Rather than contributing to this problem, I redirected my thesis toward student health.
            </p>
            <p>
                Show Me Your Colors uses HRV monitoring to track students' physiological responses during the school day. The system connects to a parent remote, allowing caregivers to understand how their child is faring in class, not through grades or behavior reports, but through direct insight into their well-being.
            </p>

            <h3>Visual feedback states</h3>
            <p>
                Early interface explorations used familiar metaphors like ice cream to represent physiological states: full (regulated), melting (transitioning), and melted (dysregulated). The goal was to make health data accessible to both children and parents.
            </p>
            <p>
                Credit to my son, Baby E, for co-creating these playful melting phases and giving the interface its joyful energy.

            <h2>Co-creation with students</h2>
            <p>
                Through participatory design sessions, students explored how to represent physiological states through color and visual metaphors. They created visual vocabularies, tested wearable prototypes, and provided feedback on what made health data feel accessible rather than clinical or stigmatizing.
            </p>

            <h2>Design process</h2>

            <h3>Research & concept (Weeks 1-3)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Conducted classroom observations and teacher interviews to identify how edtech adds complexity rather than solving problems</li>
                <li>Explored HRV monitoring as a health-first alternative to behavior tracking systems</li>
                <li>Researched existing wearable technology for children and identified accessibility gaps</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Co-design with students (Weeks 4-6)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Ran participatory design workshops with K-5 students exploring visual metaphors for physiological states</li>
                <li>Co-created ice cream visual system (full/melting/melted) that resonated with children's language</li>
                <li>Tested wearable prototypes for comfort and stigma considerations</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Technical development & testing (Weeks 7-10)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Built Arduino-based HRV monitoring system with wireless parent remote</li>
                <li>Developed visual interface balancing clarity for parents with privacy for students</li>
                <li>Conducted quick-turnaround testing with student-parent pairs to refine thresholds and displays</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Key tension</h3>
            <p>
                How do we monitor children's bodies without contributing to surveillance culture? The design prioritized transparency and caregiver partnership over institutional control.
            </p>

            <h2>HRV indicators and prototypes</h2>

            <h2>Impact</h2>
            <p>
                This project demonstrates a critical shift from edtech solutions to health-centered design. By prioritizing student well-being and giving parents transparent access to their child's physiological state, the system creates accountability and care infrastructure rather than adding another layer of classroom technology that teachers and students must navigate.
