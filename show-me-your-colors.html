                What if classroom technology prioritized student health over productivity? Show Me Your Colors is an HRV-based wearable system designed for classroom settings that shifts focus from educational outcomes to physiological well-being. As a researcher-educator, I observed how edtech creates complexity and surveillance in learning environments. Instead of adding another layer of classroom technology, this system uses heart rate variability monitoring connected to a parent remote, allowing caregivers to understand their child's physiological state throughout the school day.

            <h2>Project overview</h2>
            <p>
                As a researcher-educator working in K-12 classrooms, I witnessed firsthand how educational technology often creates more challenges than solutions by adding cognitive load, surveillance pressure, and fragmentation to already complex learning environments. Rather than contributing to this problem, I redirected my thesis toward student health.
            </p>
            <p>
                Show Me Your Colors uses HRV monitoring to track students' physiological responses during the school day. The system connects to a parent remote, allowing caregivers to understand how their child is faring in class, not through grades or behavior reports, but through direct insight into their well-being.
            </p>

            <h3>Visual feedback states</h3>
            <p>
                Early interface explorations used familiar metaphors like ice cream to represent physiological states: full (regulated), melting (transitioning), and melted (dysregulated). The goal was to make health data accessible to both children and parents.
            </p>
            <p>
                Credit to my son, Baby E, for co-creating these playful melting phases and giving the interface its joyful energy.

            <h2>Co-creation with students</h2>
            <p>
                Through participatory design sessions, students explored how to represent physiological states through color and visual metaphors. They created visual vocabularies, tested wearable prototypes, and provided feedback on what made health data feel accessible rather than clinical or stigmatizing.
            </p>

                    <p><strong>Research:</strong> Observed how edtech adds surveillance and complexity. Explored HRV monitoring as health-first alternative to behavior tracking.</p>

                    <p><strong>Co-design:</strong> K-5 students created visual metaphors for physiological states. Ice cream system (full/melting/melted) resonated most strongly.</p>

                    <p><strong>Development:</strong> Built Arduino HRV wearable with wireless parent remote. Balanced clarity for caregivers with privacy for students.</p>

                    <p><strong>Key tension:</strong> How do we monitor children's bodies without contributing to surveillance culture?</p>

            <h2>Impact</h2>
            <p>
                This project demonstrates a critical shift from edtech solutions to health-centered design. By prioritizing student well-being and giving parents transparent access to their child's physiological state, the system creates accountability and care infrastructure rather than adding another layer of classroom technology that teachers and students must navigate.
