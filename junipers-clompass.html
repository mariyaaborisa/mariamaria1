                How might we re-enchant learning through analog-digital hybridity? Juniper's Clompass turns a 1970s analog clock into a digital compass and storytelling device for children. By fusing creative literacies with technical literacy, the Clompass develops new methods of learning that inspire curiosity through making, narrative, and exploration rather than traditional instruction.

            <h2>Design & development process</h2>

            <h3>Concept: Hybrid literacies (Weeks 1-2)</h3>
            <p>
                Traditional education separates creative writing from technical building. What if we combined them? The Clompass was designed as a tool that requires both narrative imagination and technical understanding—neither complete without the other. Students don't just build a compass; they use it to navigate stories. They don't just write; they embed their writing in physical, directional space.
            </p>

            <h3>Technical prototyping (Weeks 3-5)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Sourced vintage 1970s analog clock and integrated Arduino with magnetometer sensors</li>
                <li>Programmed LCD to display cardinal directions alongside narrative prompts</li>
                <li>Designed modular electronics that invite tinkering and customization</li>
                <li>Created interface that balances technical information with story triggers</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Creative literacy design (Weeks 6-7)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Developed framework linking compass directions to narrative elements (North = beginning, South = reflection, East = adventure, West = return)</li>
                <li>Created writing prompts that emerge based on physical orientation and movement</li>
                <li>Designed activities where students build the Clompass, then use it to navigate outdoor story-worlds</li>
                <li>Integrated magnetism concepts through metaphor: "What pulls your character North? What force draws them away?"</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Pilot & learning observations (Weeks 8-10)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Tested with K-5 students who assembled Clompasses and used them for outdoor exploration</li>
                <li>Observed students naturally blending technical troubleshooting ("Why isn't North working?") with narrative problem-solving ("My character is lost—which direction should they go?")</li>
                <li>Documented how curiosity drove learning: students wanted to understand magnetism <em>because</em> it unlocked story possibilities</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Key insight</h3>
            <p>
                When creative and technical literacies are genuinely integrated—not just taught side-by-side—students develop curiosity that pulls them deeper into both domains. The Clompass doesn't teach electronics <em>and</em> storytelling; it creates a new literacy where making and narrative are inseparable.
            </p>

            <h2>Technical framework</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Arduino-based microcontroller paired with a magnetometer and LCD interface</li>
                <li>Integrated STEAM curriculum on magnetism, directionality, and creative writing</li>
                <li>Co-designed lesson plans piloted with K–5 learners to strengthen spatial reasoning</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Impact</h2>
            <p>
                The Clompass demonstrates how hybrid literacies can re-enchant learning by making technical concepts emotionally resonant and creative practices materially grounded. Students learn magnetism through story and story through space, driven by curiosity rather than curriculum mandates.
